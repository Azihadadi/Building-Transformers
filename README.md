# Building Transformers

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of advanced Transformer models using Keras. The focus is on applying Transformers to real-world sequential data tasks, specifically in the context of stock price prediction. Currently, the implementation includes the encoder part of the Transformer architecture.

## Features
- **Synthetic Stock Price Data Generation**: Generate synthetic stock price data for testing and evaluation purposes.
- **Transformer Encoder Implementation**: A complete implementation of the encoder component of the Transformer model.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Build, train, and evaluate Transformer models on the generated data.

## Getting Started
